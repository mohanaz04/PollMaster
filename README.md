# PollMaster
PollMaster is an Arduino-based embedded voting &amp; decision system for classrooms, events, and teams. Uses RC522 RFID (one-card-one-vote), 4×4 keypad input, 16×2 I2C LCD UI, RGB status LED, and buzzer feedback. Admin starts/closes sessions; results and tie detection are shown only after voting ends.
